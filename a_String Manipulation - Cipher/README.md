# String Manipulation - Cipher

## Aim
Learn **string manipulation** by building a **cipher** in Python. This project introduces fundamental programming concepts, such as **variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements**.

## Project Overview
In this project, we implement the **Vigenère cipher**, a method of encrypting and decrypting text using a **custom key**. The cipher shifts each letter based on a repeating key, making the text more secure.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**

## Concepts Covered
- String manipulation
- Variables and functions
- Loops and conditional statements

## Usage
Run the script to encrypt or decrypt text using the **Vigenère cipher**.

## Learnings
- How to manipulate strings using loops and conditions
- Implementing encryption and decryption logic
- Understanding character shifts based on a key
