# Python Learning Series

## Overview
Welcome to my **Python Learning Series**, where I document my journey of learning Python through **FreeCodeCamp's curriculum**. This repository contains projects, code snippets, and explanations of various Python concepts.

## Purpose
The goal of this series is to:
- Learn Python fundamentals
- Apply concepts through hands-on projects
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Build a strong foundation in Python programming

## Projects
Each project in this series applies the concepts learned in previous lessons. Here are some of the key projects:

- **String Manipulation - Cipher**: Learn encryption and decryption using the Vigen√®re cipher.
- **More projects will be added as I progress.**
